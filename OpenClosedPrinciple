Open/Closed Principle (OCP) states:
"A class should be open for extension but closed for modification."
ðŸ”¹ This means we should be able to extend the behavior of a class without modifying its existing code.
ðŸ”¹ This can be achieved using Abstraction & Polymorphism (Interfaces, Abstract Classes).
